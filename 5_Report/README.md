# PROJECT TITTLE - WIPER CONTROL SYSTEM #
## Abstract ##
A windscreen wiper is a device that cleans the front window of a car of rain, snow, ice, washer fluid, water or debris. Almost all motor vehicles, including automobiles, trucks, buses, train locomotives, and cabin watercraft as well as some aircraft have one or more wipers.The major function of the wiper is to remove different fluid particles off the screen by wiping them out by moving in back and forth across the glass. The basic traditional windshield wiper speed constantly varies according to time and vehicle’s speed which not only require driver’s attention but also causes a certain level of discomfort to the driver and serves as a source of distraction and problem which increases the risk of accidents.So,we here are using a STM32F4 discovery borad,a ARM microcontroller to display the vehicle filtered control system.Also an automatic rain sensors are now a must to make drivers comfortable and reduce the risk of accidents. Although such devices are on the market, they are relatively popular in the automotive industry due to their high cost and other similar limitations. The purpose of this project was to promote another low cost model in the market while maintaining efficiency.Most of the car cables are driven by a DC motor but the STM32 discovery doesn't have a motor so here we are testing the use of LEDs in this application as a wiper control.The STM32 discovery board has 4 LEDs,a push button and a reset button. The colors of these LEDs are orange, green, red and blue. The current limiting resistor connects the four user LEDs to the PD12, PD13, PD14, and PD15 PORTD pins on the recovery board. GPIO pins are configured as digital input pins to enable the button on the STM32 controller. Press and hold the user button for 2 seconds and the LED will turn red. If the ignition key is in ACC.Rain sensors, microcontrollers, and driver integrated circuits(ICs) are key components used in the construction and operation of the proposed devices.The LED will also flash to indicate that the wiper is on.This device transforms hard manual labor into a smooth automation.
## Introduction ##
A windscreen wiper or windshield wiper or wiper blade is a device used to remove rain, snow, ice, washer fluid, water from a vehicle's front window.Current car wipers works on the principle of manual switching. The traditional wiper system requires driver's constant attention in adjusting the wiper speed. Traditional windshield wiper speed constantly varies according to time and vehicle’s speed which not only require driver’s attention but also causes a certain level of discomfort to the driver's vision and serves as a source of distraction which increases the risk of accidents.So,to offer comfort to the driver and essentially reduce the risk of accidents, an automatic rain sensing device has become a necessity, as they work to minimize the time of the driver.Automatic rain sensing wiper system detects rain and starts automatically and also stops when the rain stops.

* The STM32F407 Discovery board uses STM32F407VGT6 Microcontroller which has ARM Cortex-M4F Processor, which is capable of running upto 168Mhz. This MCU has many peripherals such as GPIO ports, TIMERS, ADCs, DACs, Flash Memory, SRAM, SPI, UART ect. The processor and peripherals talk via BUS-Interface. There are three busses available.

* I-BUS (Instruction Bus) D-BUS (Data Bus) S-BUS (System Bus) I-BUS This bus connects the Instruction bus of the Cortex®-M4 with FPU(Floating point unit) core to the BusMatrix. This bus is used by the core to fetch instructions. The target of this bus is a memory containing code (internal Flash memory/SRAM or external memories through the FSMC/FMC).

* D-BUS This bus connects the databus of the Cortex®-M4 with FPU to the 64-Kbyte CCM data RAM to the BusMatrix. This bus is used by the core for literal load and debug access. The target of this bus is a memory containing code or data (internal Flash memory or external memories through the FSMC/FMC).

* S-BUS This bus connects the system bus of the Cortex®-M4 with FPU core to a BusMatrix. This bus is used to access data located in a peripheral or in SRAM. Instructions may also be fetched on this bus (less efficient than ICode). The targets of this bus are the internal SRAM1, SRAM2 and SRAM3, the AHB1 peripherals including the APB peripherals, the AHB2 peripherals and the external memories through the FSMC/FMC.

* So instructions and data use I-bus and D-bus respectively, All the other peripheral uses System bus. The Cortex-M4 processor contains three external Advanced High-performance Bus (AHB)-Lite bus interface and one Advanced Peripheral Bus (APB) interface. The GPIOs are connected to AHB1 bus which has a maximum speed of 150Mhz and is divided into two buses as APB1 and APB2. APB1 runs at 42Mhz(max) and APB2 runs at 82Mhz(max). The different peripherals such as SPI, UART, TIMERs, ADCs, DACs, etc are connected to either APB1/APB2 buses. And the AHB2(168Mhz max) is connected to Camera and USB OTG interfaces, AHB3 is connected to External memory controller.


## Working Principle ##
Assume that the automobile is the microcontroller(STM32F407VG). If the button is pressed , the first led (red) will turn on, Clicking again the wiper will starts , and the second led (blue) will turn on for a desired rate. If the button is pressed again , the third led (green) will turn on, and the wiper's speed will be increased in comparison to the previous one. The fourth press will turn on the fourth led (orange) , and the wiper speed will be increased in accordance with the previous one. The microcontroller (vehicle) is turned off after the fifth click of the button.

## What ##
The operational speed of a vehicle wiper is controlled by a wiper speed control mechanism based on rain conditions. To generate, the control system incorporates a rain sensor (30) that detects rain conditions. The amplitude of an analogue signal depends on the detected rain conditions.
## Why ##
To clean the windscreen clean enough to give adequate view at all times from the front and rear windshields of the car.Wiper cleans the windshield by removing oil, dust, moisture, and grime that have become attached to the glass.
## Who ##
 It is extremely important for drivers of any type of vehicle that require clear road visibility in the event of dust, snow, or rain.
## When ##
When the weather is terrible, such as snow, dust, or rain and so the windshield wipers remove rain and snow from the windshield, while the headlights improve visibility at night.
## How ##
It is implemented using the STM32 microcontroller and once when the rain droplets fall on the windshield of the vehicle.
